# Color scheme
### Instalation:
I do not know if this works actually.
I do advice to change this stuff manually, but here is the code I got:
```
git clone https://github.com/RaitaroH/LibreOffice-BreezeDark.git
cp ~/.config/libreoffice/4/user/registrymodifications.xcu ~/.config/libreoffice/4/user/registrymodifications.xcu.back
cat LibreOffice-BreezeDark/standard.soc >> ~/.config/libreoffice/4/user/registrymodifications.xcu
```
Alternatively you can do it manually. Here are some screenshots to help you.

Please be careful that cutting cells can leave white spaces in their place. It is best to try and fill every cell with the background color.  I suggest to go to: Styles and formating > Cell Styles > Default > Modify. There you can do the needed changes. 
Also keep in mind that you will have to manually change charts.

Make sure you change the background color in impress. Otherwise it will change to white.

You can also export in pdf too:

The export from WRITER in pdf changes the background to white and text to black AS LONG AS it is AUTOMATIC. Any further changes to the colors will be exported.
